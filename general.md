General
=======

These guidelines apply to just about any sort of code that you might write.

Comments
--------
* Write comments for your future self.
  * In other words, if you think you need a comment to remember something, then write that comment.
  * But make comments readable by others who might not have the full backing details.
  * Explain things that might take some time to figure out the next time you're reading the code.
  * Explain why you're doing something, and anything tricky that might not be obvious to others or your future self.
* Try to make code reveal its intent without the need for a comment -- but if that cannot be done, then write a comment.
* Prefer placing short comments on the line of code they describe.
  * So that if the line is changed, it's more likely that the comment will be changed.
